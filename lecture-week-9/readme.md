- - Difference between linked list and list

# Linked list

-Data type, where every element has reference to the previous one.
-Randomly put in the memory
-only element (a) knows address of element (a + 1)
-works great for optimized use of memory
-slower, due to requirement for more operations to the last n-th element;
-heavier, due to pointer usage.
